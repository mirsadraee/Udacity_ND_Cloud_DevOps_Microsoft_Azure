# Cloud DevOps using Microsoft Azure
## Lesson 1: Introduction to Agile Development
We started off the course by considering the underlying problems that Agile solves for, and by introducing you to some of the core concepts and tools underlying the Agile approachâ€”such as Kaizen and the Five Why's.

## Lesson 2: Agile Planning and Communication
In this lesson, we saw how you can use effective project management and technical communication to help ensure you're working on what matters and avoiding typical problems that get in the way of software delivery.

## Lesson 3: Continuous Integration
Next, we looked at how to use Azure to do Continuous Integration (CI). We walked through how to set up Azure Cloud Shell and evaluate different build server options.

## Lesson 4: Continuous Delivery
In this lesson, we looked at how to leverage infrastructure automation in our development lifecycle so that we can achieve Continuous Delivery (CD). We also looked at how we can implement an effective microservices strategy and how this approach fits well with our underlying Agile and DevOps goals.
